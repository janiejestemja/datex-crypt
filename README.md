## Workflow
---

Notation 
- `msg` = message to encrypt
- `k_msg` = ephemeral symmetric key for this message
- `ek_i` = ephemeral key for recipient `i`
- `pk_i`, `sk_i` = long-term public/private key of recipient `i`
- `wrap(k_msg, ss)` = key wrap using shared secret `ss`
- `enc(k_msg, msg)`= symmetric encryption of message with `k_msg` 
- `dh(pri, pub)` = (ec) diffie-hellman operation

**Sender**
1. Generate ephemeral symmetric key `k_msg` 
```
random key (128/256 bits) -> k_msg
```

2. Encrypt `msg`
```
enc(k_msg, msg) -> cipher
```

3. For each recipient `i`:

  - 1. Generate recipient specific ephemeral keypar

  ```
  ephemeral key pair -> (ek_i_pri, ek_i_pub)
  ```

  - 2. Derive a shared secred with recipients long-term public key
  ```
  dh(ek_i_pri, pk_i) -> ss_i 
  ```

  - 3. Wrap the message key k_msg with the shared secret
  ```
  wrap(k_msg, ss_i) -> WrappedKey_i 
  ```

  - 4. Prepaire payload
  ```
  -> (ek_i_pub, WrappedKey_i, cipher)
  ```

4. Send each recpipient their payload


**Recipient i**
1. recieve tuple 
```
(ek_i_pub, WrappedKey_i, cipher)
```
2. derive shared secret using long term private key
```
dh(sk_i, ek_i_pub) -> ss_i 
```
3. Unwrap the message key
```
unwrap(WrappedKey_i, ss_i) -> k_msg 
```
4. Decrypt the message
```
dec(k_msg, cipher) -> msg 
```

**Properties**
- Forward secrecy
  - each recipients eph key is destroyed after use, thus compromise of the long-term private key of the sender does not expose past messages
- multi recipient
  - each recipient gets a unique eph key + wrapped key, thus the message ciphertext is only encrypted once
- no meta leak compromise
  - only the fact thtat the same message was sent to multiple recipients might be inferred - keys remain secure
